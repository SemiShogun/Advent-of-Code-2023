# Advent of Code 2023

It sure is **poggers** to be in that time of the year.

## 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS

In the quirky workshop at the North Pole, chaos erupted as Santa faced an onslaught of zombies, giants, and skeleton reindeers. Satan Claus, the evil clone with a penchant for mischief, led the charge to destroy Santa's festive base.

Santa, in his red suit and fat juicy  cheeks, grabbed a candy cane like a makeshift weapon. His elves, armed with snowball launchers, joined the bizarre battle. Meanwhile, Rudolph, now a skeleton reindeer with glowing red eyes, pranced around like a macabre dancer.

The zombies stumbled, the giants roared, and the skeleton reindeers clicked their bony hooves. Satan Claus unleashed coal golems that pelted the workshop with naughty intent.

But Santa wasn't one to back down. He rallied the gingerbread cookie brigade, armed with frosting pistols. Together, they formed a sugary barricade against the chaos.

Just when things seemed dire, Mrs. Claus emerged with a giant plate of freshly baked cookies. The scent wafted through the air, distracting the zombies and giants alike.

Seizing the moment, Santa and his crew launched a counterattack, pelting the invaders with snowballs and covering them in frosting. Satan Claus slipped on a puddle of hot cocoa, and the skeleton reindeers tripped over candy cane traps.

With the invaders defeated and the workshop saved, Santa chuckled and declared, "No one messes with Christmas on my watch!" The elves cheered, and even the skeleton reindeers clattered in what seemed like skeletal applause. Another holiday saved, thanks to the absurdity of Santa's unexpected defense.
